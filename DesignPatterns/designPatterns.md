### Object-Oriented Design

- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation

Not enough to design, maintain and extend.

### Purpose of DP
- Solutions developed overtime for most common OO design problems

### Design Patterns (23)

| Creational Patterns | Structural Patterns | Behavioural Patterns |
| --------         | ------- | -------- |
| Abstract Factory | Adapter   | Chain of Responsibility|
| Builder          | Bridge    | Command |
| Factory Method   | Composite | Iterator|
| Prototype        | Decorator | Mediator |
| Singleton        | Facade    | Memento |
|                  | Flyweight | Observer |
|                  |           | State |
|                  |           | Strategy |
|                  |           | Template |
|                  |           | Visitor |

### Benefits
- Not reinvent the wheels
- Building resilient code
- Preparing future additions


If one object changes, several objects might need to about the change. Is there a way to structure objects so they aren't too tightly dependent on one another? -> Observer design pattern.

### Design principles
- Single responsibility
- Open-closed
- Loose coupling
- Use composition rather than inheritance
- Program to an interface, not an implementation
- Encapsulate what varies
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Polymorphism
- Ihheritance

| Principles are general guidelines | specific design solutions often aimed at solvingt common OO problems |

### Encapsulate what varies
- Identify the aspect of your application that vary and seperate them from what stays the same.
